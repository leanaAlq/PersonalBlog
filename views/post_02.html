            <strong>FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY</strong> the eminent physicist
            Freeman Dyson has quietly resided in Prince­ton, N.J., on the wooded
            former farmland that is home to his employer, the Institute for
            Advanced Study, this country’s most rarefied community of scholars.
            Lately, however, since coming “out of the closet as far as global
            warming is concerned,” as Dyson sometimes puts it, there has been
            noise all around him. Chat rooms, Web threads, editors’ letter boxes
            and Dyson’s own e-mail queue resonate with a thermal current of
            invective in which Dyson has discovered himself variously described
            as “a pompous twit,” “a blowhard,” “a cesspool of misinformation,”
            “an old coot riding into the sunset” and, perhaps inevitably, “a mad
            scientist.” Dyson had proposed that whatever inflammations the
            climate was experiencing might be a good thing because carbon
            dioxide helps plants of all kinds grow. Then he added the caveat
            that if CO2 levels soared too high, they could be soothed by the
            mass cultivation of specially bred “carbon-eating trees,” whereupon
            the University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner looked through
            the thick grove of honorary degrees Dyson has been awarded — there
            are 21 from universities like Georgetown, Princeton and Oxford — and
            suggested that “perhaps trees can also be designed so that they can
            give directions to lost hikers.” Dyson’s son, George, a technology
            historian, says his father’s views have cooled friendships, while
            many others have concluded that time has cost Dyson something else.
            There is the suspicion that, at age 85, a great scientist of the
            20th century is no longer just far out, he is far gone — out of his
            beautiful mind.

            But in the considered opinion of the neurologist Oliver Sacks,
            Dyson’s friend and fellow English expatriate, this is far from the
            case. “His mind is still so open and flexible,” Sacks says. Which
            makes Dyson something far more formidable than just the latest
            peevish right-wing climate-change denier. Dyson is a scientist whose
            intelligence is revered by other scientists — William Press, former
            deputy director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and now a
            professor of computer science at the University of Texas, calls him
            “infinitely smart.” Dyson — a mathematics prodigy who came to this
            country at 23 and right away contributed seminal work to physics by
            unifying quantum and electrodynamic theory — not only did
            path-breaking science of his own; he also witnessed the development
            of modern physics, thinking alongside most of the luminous figures
            of the age, including Einstein, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, Enrico
            Fermi, Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward
            Witten, the “high priest of string theory” whose office at the
            institute is just across the hall from Dyson’s. Yet instead of
            hewing to that fundamental field, Dyson chose to pursue broader and
            more unusual pursuits than most physicists — and has lived a more
            original life.

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Among Dyson’s gifts is interpretive clarity, a penetrating ability
            to grasp the method and significance of what many kinds of
            scientists do. His thoughts about how science works appear in a
            series of lucid, elegant books for nonspecialists that have made him
            a trusted arbiter of ideas ranging far beyond physics. Dyson has
            written more than a dozen books, including “Origins of Life” (1999),
            which synthesizes recent discoveries by biologists and geologists
            into an evaluation of the double-origin hypothesis, the possibility
            that life began twice; “Disturbing the Universe” (1979) tries among
            other things to reconcile science and humanity. “Weapons and Hope”
            (1984) is his meditation on the meaning and danger of nuclear
            weapons that won a National Book Critics Circle Award. Dyson’s books
            display such masterly control of complex matters that smart young
            people read him and want to be scientists; older citizens finish his
            books and feel smart.

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Yet even while probing and sifting, Dyson is always whimsically
            gazing into the beyond. As a boy he sketched plans for English
            rocket ships that could explore the stars, and then, in midlife, he
            helped design an American spacecraft to be powered by exploding
            atomic bombs — a secret Air Force project known as Orion. Dyson
            remains an armchair astronaut who speculates with glee about the
            coming of cheap space travel, when families can leave an overcrowded
            earth to homestead on asteroids and comets, swooping around the
            universe via solar sail craft. Dyson is convinced that our current
            “age of computers” will soon give way to “the age of domesticated
            biotechnology.” Bio-tech, he writes in his book, “Infinite in All
            Directions” (1988), “offers us the chance to imitate nature’s speed
            and flexibility,” and he imagines the furniture and art that people
            will “grow” for themselves, the pet dinosaurs they will “grow” for
            their children, along with an idiosyncratic menagerie of genetically
            engineered cousins of the carbon-eating tree: termites to consume
            derelict automobiles, a potato capable of flourishing on the dry red
            surfaces of Mars, a collision-avoiding car.

      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            These ideas attract derision similar to Dyson’s essays on climate
            change, but he is an undeterred octogenarian futurist. “I don’t
            think of myself predicting things,” he says. “I’m expressing
            possibilities. Things that could happen. To a large extent it’s a
            question of how badly people want them to. The purpose of thinking
            about the future is not to predict it but to raise people’s hopes.”
            Formed in a heretical and broad-thinking tradition of British public
            intellectuals, Dyson left behind a brooding England still stricken
            by two bloody world wars to become an optimistic American immigrant
            with tremendous faith in the creative imagination’s ability to
            invent technologies that would overcome any predicament. And
            according to the physicist and former Caltech president Marvin
            Goldberger, Dyson is himself the living embodiment of that kind of
            ingenuity. “You point Freeman at a problem and he’ll solve it,”
            Goldberger says. “He’s extraordinarily powerful.” Dyson seems to see
            the world as an interdisciplinary set of problems out there for him
            to evaluate. Climate change is the big scientific issue of our time,
            so naturally he finds it irresistible. But to Dyson this is really
            only one more charged conundrum attracting his interest just as
            nuclear weapons and rural poverty have. That is to say, he is a
            great problem-solver who is not convinced that climate change is a
            great problem.

            Dyson is well aware that “most consider me wrong about global
            warming.” That educated Americans tend to agree with the conclusion
            about global warming reached earlier this month at the International
            Scientific Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen (“inaction is
            inexcusable”) only increases Dyson’s resistance. Dyson may be an
            Obama-loving, Bush-loathing liberal who has spent his life opposing
            American wars and fighting for the protection of natural resources,
            but he brooks no ideology and has a withering aversion to scientific
            consensus. The Nobel physics laureate Steven Weinberg admires
            Dyson’s physics — he says he thinks the Nobel committee fleeced him
            by not awarding his work on quantum electrodynamics with the prize —
            but Weinberg parts ways with his sensibility: “I have the sense that
            when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will
            do his best to chip at the ice.”

            Dyson says he doesn’t want his legacy to be defined by climate
            change, but his dissension from the orthodoxy of global warming is
            significant because of his stature and his devotion to the integrity
            of science. Dyson has said he believes that the truths of science
            are so profoundly concealed that the only thing we can really be
            sure of is that much of what we expect to happen won’t come to pass.
            In “Infinite in All Directions,” he writes that nature’s laws “make
            the universe as interesting as possible.” This also happens to be a
            fine description of Dyson’s own relationship to science. In the
            words of Avishai Margalit, a philosopher at the Institute for
            Advanced Study, “He’s a consistent reminder of another possibility.”
            When Dyson joins the public conversation about climate change by
            expressing concern about the “enormous gaps in our knowledge, the
            sparseness of our observations and the superficiality of our
            theories,” these reservations come from a place of experience.
            Whatever else he is, Dyson is the good scientist; he asks the hard
            questions. He could also be a lonely prophet. Or, as he
            acknowledges, he could be dead wrong.

            <strong>IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO</strong> that Dyson began publicly
            stating his doubts about climate change. Speaking at the Frederick
            S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future at Boston
            University, Dyson announced that “all the fuss about global warming
            is grossly exaggerated.” Since then he has only heated up his
            misgivings, declaring in a 2007 interview with Salon.com that “the
            fact that the climate is getting warmer doesn’t scare me at all” and
            writing in an essay for The New York Review of Books, the
            left-leaning publication that is to gravitas what the Beagle was to
            Darwin, that climate change has become an “obsession” — the primary
            article of faith for “a worldwide secular religion” known as
            environmentalism. Among those he considers true believers, Dyson has
            been particularly dismissive of Al Gore, whom Dyson calls climate
            change’s “chief propagandist,” and James Hansen, the head of the
            NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and an adviser
            to Gore’s film, “An Inconvenient Truth.” Dyson accuses them of
            relying too heavily on computer-generated climate models that
            foresee a <em>Grand Guignol</em> of imminent world devastation as
            icecaps melt, oceans rise and storms and plagues sweep the earth,
            and he blames the pair’s “lousy science” for “distracting public
            attention” from “more serious and more immediate dangers to the
            planet.”
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            A particularly distressed member of that public was Dyson’s own
            wife, Imme, who, after seeing the film in a local theater with Dyson
            when it was released in 2006, looked at her husband out on the
            sidewalk and, with visions of drowning polar bears still in her
            eyes, reproached him: “Everything you told me is wrong!” she cried.

      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>“The polar bears will be fine,” he assured her.</p>
          <p>
            Not long ago Dyson sat in his institute office, a chamber so neat it
            reminds Dyson’s friend, the writer John McPhee, of a Japanese living
            room. On shelves beside Dyson were books about stellar evolution,
            viruses, thermodynamics and terrorism. “The climate-studies people
            who work with models always tend to overestimate their models,”
            Dyson was saying. “They come to believe models are real and forget
            they are only models.” Dyson speaks in calm, clear tones that carry
            simultaneous evidence of his English childhood, the move to the
            United States after completing his university studies at Cambridge
            and more than 50 years of marriage to the German-born Imme, but his
            opinions can be barbed, especially when a conversation turns to
            climate change. Climate models, he says, take into account
            atmospheric motion and water levels but have no feeling for the
            chemistry and biology of sky, soil and trees. “The biologists have
            essentially been pushed aside,” he continues. “Al Gore’s just an
            opportunist. The person who is really responsible for this
            overestimate of global warming is Jim Hansen. He consistently
            exaggerates all the dangers.”

            Dyson agrees with the prevailing view that there are rapidly rising
            carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere caused by human activity. To
            the planet, he suggests, the rising carbon may well be a MacGuffin,
            a striking yet ultimately benign occurrence in what Dyson says is
            still “a relatively cool period in the earth’s history.” The
            warming, he says, is not global but local, “making cold places
            warmer rather than making hot places hotter.” Far from expecting any
            drastic harmful consequences from these increased temperatures, he
            says the carbon may well be salubrious — a sign that “the climate is
            actually improving rather than getting worse,” because carbon acts
            as an ideal fertilizer promoting forest growth and crop yields.
            “Most of the evolution of life occurred on a planet substantially
            warmer than it is now,” he contends, “and substantially richer in
            carbon dioxide.” Dyson calls ocean acidification, which many
            scientists say is destroying the saltwater food chain, a genuine but
            probably exaggerated problem. Sea levels, he says, are rising
            steadily, but why this is and what dangers it might portend “cannot
            be predicted until we know much more about its causes.”

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            For Hansen, the dark agent of the looming environmental apocalypse
            is carbon dioxide contained in coal smoke. Coal, he has written, “is
            the single greatest threat to civilization and all life on our
            planet.” Hansen has referred to railroad cars transporting coal as
            “death trains.” Dyson, on the other hand, told me in conversations
            and e-mail messages that “Jim Hansen’s crusade against coal
            overstates the harm carbon dioxide can do.” Dyson well remembers the
            lethal black London coal fog of his youth when, after a day of
            visiting the city, he would return to his hometown of Winchester
            with his white shirt collar turned black. Coal, Dyson says, contains
            “real pollutants” like soot, sulphur and nitrogen oxides, “really
            nasty stuff that makes people sick and looks ugly.” These are
            “rightly considered a moral evil,” he says, but they “can be reduced
            to low levels by scrubbers at an affordable cost.” He says Hansen
            “exploits” the toxic elements of burning coal as a way of condemning
            the carbon dioxide it releases, “which cannot be reduced at an
            affordable cost, but does not do any substantial harm.”

            Science is not a matter of opinion; it is a question of data.
            Climate change is an issue for which Dyson is asking for more
            evidence, and leading climate scientists are replying by saying if
            we wait for sufficient proof to satisfy you, it may be too late.
            That is the position of a more moderate expert on climate change,
            William Chameides, dean of the Nicholas School of the Environment
            and Earth Sciences at Duke University, who says, “I don’t think it’s
            time to panic,” but contends that, because of global warming, “more
            sea-level rise is inevitable and will displace millions; melting
            high-altitude glaciers will threaten the food supplies for perhaps a
            billion or more; and ocean acidification could undermine the food
            supply of another billion or so.” Dyson strongly disagrees with each
            of these points, and there follows, as you move back and forth
            between the two positions, claims and counterclaims, a dense thicket
            of mitigating scientific indicators that all have the timbre of
            truth and the ring of potential plausibility. One of Dyson’s more
            significant surmises is that a warming climate could be forestalling
            a new ice age. Is he wrong? No one can say for sure. Beyond the
            specific points of factual dispute, Dyson has said that it all boils
            down to “a deeper disagreement about values” between those who think
            “nature knows best” and that “any gross human disruption of the
            natural environment is evil,” and “humanists,” like himself, who
            contend that protecting the existing biosphere is not as important
            as fighting more repugnant evils like war, poverty and unemployment.

            Embedded in all of Dyson’s strong opinions about public policy is a
            dual spirit of social activism and uneasiness about class dating all
            the way back to Winchester, where he was raised in the 1920s and
            ’30s by his father, George Dyson, the son of a Yorkshire blacksmith.
            George was the music instructor at Winchester College, an old and
            prestigious secondary school, and a composer. Dyson’s mother,
            Mildred Atkey, came from a more prosperous Wimbledon family that had
            its own tennis court. Together they raised Dyson and his sister,
            Alice, in what Dyson calls a “watered-down Church of England
            Christianity” that regarded religion as a guide to living rather
            than any system of belief. The emphasis on tolerance, charity and
            community — and the free time afforded by the luxury of four
            servants — led Mildred to organize a club for teenage girls and a
            birth-control clinic. These institutions meshed uneasily with her
            patrician Victorian sensibilities. The girls were never, Dyson says,
            “considered equals,” and Mildred told him with amusement about the
            young mother who walked in carrying a red-headed infant. “What a
            beautiful baby,” Mildred reported saying. “Does he take after his
            father?”

            “Oh, I couldn’t tell you, Mum,” came the reply. “He kept his hat
            on.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Winchester is a medieval town in which, Dyson writes, he felt that
            everyone was looking backward, mourning all the young men lost to
            one world war while silently anticipating his own generation’s
            impending demise. He renounced the nostalgia, the servants, the
            hard-line social castes. But what he liked about growing up in
            England was the landscape. The country’s successful alteration of
            wilderness and swamp had created a completely new green ecology,
            allowing plants, animals and humans to thrive in “a community of
            species.” Dyson has always been strongly opposed to the idea that
            there is any such thing as an optimal ecosystem — “life is always
            changing” — and he abhors the notion that men and women are
            something apart from nature, that “we must apologize for being
            human.” Humans, he says, have a duty to restructure nature for their
            survival.

            All this may explain why the same man could write “we live on a
            shrinking and vulnerable planet which our lack of foresight is
            rapidly turning into a slum” and yet gently chide the sort of
            Americans who march against coal in Washington. Dyson has great
            affection for coal and for one big reason: It is so inexpensive that
            most of the world can afford it. “There’s a lot of truth to the
            statement Greens are people who never had to worry about their
            grocery bills,” he says. (“Many of these people are my friends,” he
            will also tell you.) To Dyson, “the move of the populations of China
            and India from poverty to middle-class prosperity should be the
            great historic achievement of the century. Without coal it cannot
            happen.” That said, Dyson sees coal as the interim kindling of
            progress. In “roughly 50 years,” he predicts, solar energy will
            become cheap and abundant, and “there are many good reasons for
            preferring it to coal.”

            <strong>THE WORDS COLLEAGUES COMMONLY</strong> use to describe Dyson
            include “unassuming” and “modest,” and he seems the very embodiment
            of Newton’s belief that a man should strive for simplicity and avoid
            confusion in life. Dyson has been in residence at the institute
            since 1953, a time when Albert Einstein shared his habit of walking
            to work there, which Dyson still does seven days a week, to write on
            a computer and solve any problems that come across his desk with
            paper and pencil. (In his prime, legend held that he never used the
            eraser.) He and Imme have spent 51 happy years together in the same
            house, a white clapboard just over the garden fence from the stucco
            affair once inhabited by their former neighbors, the Oppenheimers.
            On some Sundays the Dysons pile into a car still decorated with an
            Obama bumper sticker and drive to running races, at which Dyson can
            be found at the finish line loudly cheering for the 72-year-old
            Imme, a master’s marathon champion. On many other weekends, they
            visit some of their 16 grandchildren. During the holiday season the
            Dysons routinely attend five parties a week, cocktail-soiree sprints
            at which guests tend to find him open-minded and shy: when friends’
            wives give him a hug, he blushes. One of Dyson’s daughters, the
            Internet vizier Esther Dyson, says her father raised her without a
            television so she would read more, and has always been “just as
            interested in talking to” the latest graduate student to make the
            pilgrimage to Princeton “as he is the famous person at the next
            table.” Oliver Sacks says that Dyson has “a genius for friendship.”

            But the truth is that Dyson is an elusive particle. To Edward Witten
            it is clear that Dyson has little use for string theory, the
            cutting-edge “theory of everything” that links quantum mechanics and
            relativity in an effort to describe no less than the nature of all
            things. Even so, Witten admits that there is a fever-dream quality
            to his conversations with Dyson: “I don’t always know what he
            disagrees with entirely. His attitudes are complicated. There are
            many layers.” Other people can be similarly intrigued and baffled.
            When I began spending time with Dyson and asked who his close
            friends are, the only name he mentioned was John McPhee’s, which
            surprised McPhee since he said he doesn’t often speak with Dyson
            even though McPhee teaches nearby at Princeton University. All six
            of Dyson’s children describe him as a loving, intensely devoted
            father and yet also suggest that this is a parent with, in the words
            of his son, George, core parts of him that have always seemed
            “remote.” William Press said he finds Dyson to be both a “deep” and
            “magnificently laudable person” and also mysterious and inscrutable,
            a man with contrarian opinions that Press suspects may be motivated
            by “a darker side he’s determined the world isn’t going to see.”
            When I asked Sacks what he thought about all this, he said that “a
            favorite word of Freeman’s about doing science and being creative is
            the word ‘subversive.’ He feels it’s rather important not only to be
            not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he’s done that all his
            life.”

            Dyson says it’s only principle that leads him to question global
            warming: “According to the global-warming people, I say what I say
            because I’m paid by the oil industry. Of course I’m not, but that’s
            part of their rhetoric. If you doubt it, you’re a bad person, a tool
            of the oil or coal industry.” Global warming, he added, “has become
            a party line.”

          <p>
            What may trouble Dyson most about climate change are the experts.
            Experts are, he thinks, too often crippled by the conventional
            wisdom they create, leading to the belief that “they know it all.”
            The men he most admires tend to be what he calls “amateurs,”
            inventive spirits of uncredentialed brilliance like Bernhard
            Schmidt, an eccentric one-armed alcoholic telescope-lens designer;
            Milton Humason, a janitor at Mount Wilson Observatory in California
            whose native scientific aptitude was such that he was promoted to
            staff astronomer; and especially Darwin, who, Dyson says, “was
            really an amateur and beat the professionals at their own game.”
            It’s a point of pride with Dyson that in 1951 he became a member of
            the physics faculty at Cornell and then, two years later, moved on
            to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he became an influential
            man, a pragmatist providing solutions to the military and Congress,
            and also the 2000 winner of the $1 million Templeton Prize for
            broadening the understanding of science and religion, an award
            previously given to Mother Teresa and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn — all
            without ever earning a Ph.D. Dyson may, in fact, be the ultimate
            outsider-insider, “the world’s most civil heretic,” as the classical
            composer Paul Moravec, the artistic consultant at the institute,
            says of him.

            Climate-change specialists often speak of global warming as a matter
            of moral conscience. Dyson says he thinks they sound presumptuous.
            As he warned that day four years ago at Boston University, the
            history of science is filled with those “who make confident
            predictions about the future and end up believing their
            predictions,” and he cites examples of things people anticipated to
            the point of terrified certainty that never actually occurred,
            ranging from hellfire, to Hitler’s atomic bomb, to the Y2K
            millennium bug. “It’s always possible Hansen could turn out to be
            right,” he says of the climate scientist. “If what he says were
            obviously wrong, he wouldn’t have achieved what he has. But Hansen
            has turned his science into ideology. He’s a very persuasive fellow
            and has the air of knowing everything. He has all the credentials. I
            have none. I don’t have a Ph.D. He’s published hundreds of papers on
            climate. I haven’t. By the public standard he’s qualified to talk
            and I’m not. But I do because I think I’m right. I think I have a
            broad view of the subject, which Hansen does not. I think it’s true
            my career doesn’t depend on it, whereas his does. I never claim to
            be an expert on climate. I think it’s more a matter of judgement
            than knowledge.”

            Reached by telephone, Hansen sounds annoyed as he says, “There are
            bigger fish to fry than Freeman Dyson,” who “doesn’t know what he’s
            talking about.” In an e-mail message, he adds that his own concern
            about global warming is not based only on models, and that while he
            respects the “open-mindedness” of Dyson, “if he is going to wander
            into something with major consequences for humanity and other life
            on the planet, then he should first do his homework — which he
            obviously has not done on global warming.”

            When Dyson hears about this, he looks, if possible, like a person
            taking the longer view. He is a short, sinewy man with strawlike
            filaments of excitable gray hair that make him resemble an
            upside-down broom. Every day he dresses with the same frowzy
            Oxbridge formality in L. L. Bean khaki trousers (his daughter Mia is
            a minister in Maine), a tweed sport coat, a necktie (most often one
            made for him, he says, by another daughter, Emily, many years ago
            “in the age of primary colors”) and wool sweater-vests. On cold days
            he wears a second vest, one right over the other, and the effect is
            like a window with two sets of curtains. His smile is the real
            window, a delighted beam that appears to float free from his face,
            strangely dynamic with its electric ears and quantum nose, and his
            laugh is so hearty it shakes him. The smile and laughter have the
            effect of softening Dyson’s formality, transforming him into a sage
            and friendly elf, and also reminding those he talks with that he has
            spent a lifetime immersed in efforts to find what he considers
            humane solutions to dire problems, whose controversial gloss never
            seems to agitate him. His eyes are murky gray, and whatever he’s
            thinking beyond what he says, the eyes never betray.

            <strong>A FORMATIVE MOMENT</strong> in Dyson’s life that pushed him
            in an apostatical direction happened in 1932, when, at age 8, he was
            sent off to boarding school at Twyford. By then he was a prodigy
            “already obsessed” with mathematics. (His older sister Alice, a
            retired social worker still living in Winchester, remembers how her
            brother “used to lie on the nursery floor working out how many atoms
            there were in the sun. He was perhaps 4.”) At Twyford — like George
            Orwell, who was flogged, starved and humiliated by masters and
            bigger boys at St. Cyprian’s — Dyson says he felt brutalized by a
            whip-wielding headmaster who offered no science classes, favoring
            Latin, and by a clique of athletes who liked to rub sandpaper on the
            faces of the smaller children. “In those days it was unthinkable
            that parents would come to see what was going on,” Dyson says. “My
            parents lived only three miles away. They never came to visit. It
            wasn’t done.” Dyson took comfort in climbing tall trees, reading
            “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” which gave him a first sense of
            America as a more “exciting place where all sorts of weird things
            could happen,” and Jules Verne’s comic science-fiction descriptions
            of more “crazy Americans” bound for the moon. His primary
            consolation, however, was the science society he founded with a few
            friends. Dyson would later reflect that from then on he saw science
            as “a territory of freedom and friendship in the midst of tyranny
            and hatred.”

            Four years later he entered Winchester College, well known for
            academic rigor, and he thrived. On his own in the school library, he
            read mathematical works in French and German and, at age 13, taught
            himself calculus from an Encyclopedia Britannica entry. “I remember
            thinking, Is that it?” he says. “People had been telling me how hard
            it was.” Another day in the library he discovered “Daedalus, or
            Science and the Future,” by the biologist J. B. S. Haldane, who said
            that “the thing that has not been is the thing that shall be; that
            no beliefs, no values, no institutions are safe,” an appealing
            outlook to Dyson, who had found his muse. “Haldane was even more of
            a heretic than I am,” he says. “He really loved to make people
            angry.” It wasn’t all science. On trips into London he spent entire
            days in bookstores where William Blake “got hold of me. What I
            really liked was he was a really rebellious spirit who always said
            the opposite of what everybody else believed.”

        <div>
          <p>
            That defiant sensibility hardened further when the second war with
            Germany began. Dyson says he can “remember so vividly lying in bed
            at age 15, absolutely enjoying hearing the bombs go off with a
            wonderful crunching noise. I said, ‘That’s the sound of the British
            Empire crumbling.’ I had a sense that the British Empire was evil.
            The fact that I might get hit didn’t register at all. I think that’s
            a natural state of mind for a 15-year-old. I somehow got over it.”
            At Cambridge, Dyson attended all the advanced mathematics lectures
            and climbed roofs at night during blackouts. By the end of the
            school year in 1943, which Dyson celebrated by pushing his
            wheelchairbound classmate, Oscar Hahn, the 55 miles home to London
            in one 17-hour day, Dyson was fully formed as a person of strong,
            frequently rebellious beliefs, someone who would always go his own
            way.

            During World War II, Dyson worked for the Royal Air Force at Bomber
            Command, calculating the most effective ways to deploy pilots, some
            of whom he knew would die. Dyson says he was “sickened” and
            “depressed” that many more planes were going down than needed to
            because military leadership relied on misguided institutional
            mythologies rather than statistical studies. Even more upsetting,
            Dyson writes in “Weapons and Hope,” he became an expert on “how to
            murder most economically another hundred thousand people.” This
            work, Dyson told the writer Kenneth Brower, created an “emptiness of
            the soul.”

            Then came two blinding flashes of light. Dyson’s reaction to
            Hiroshima and Nagasaki was complicated. Like many physicists, Dyson
            has always loved explosions, and, of course, uncovering the secrets
            of nature is the first motivation of science. When he was
            interviewed for the 1980 documentary “The Day After Trinity,” Dyson
            addressed the seduction: “I felt it myself, the glitter of nuclear
            weapons. It is irresistible if you come to them as a scientist. To
            feel it’s there in your hands. To release the energy that fuels the
            stars. To let it do your bidding. And to perform these miracles, to
            lift a million tons of rock into the sky, it is something that gives
            people an illusion of illimitable power, and it is in some ways
            responsible for all our troubles, I would say, this what you might
            call ‘technical arrogance’ that overcomes people when they see what
            they can do with their minds.”

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Eventually, Dyson would be sure nuclear weapons were the worst evil.
            But in 1945, drawn to these irreducible components of life, Dyson
            left mathematics and took up physics. Still, he did not want to be
            another dusty Englishman toiling alone in a dim Cambridge
            laboratory. Since childhood, some part of him had always known that
            the “Americans held the future in their hands and that the smart
            thing for me to do would be to join them.” That the United States
            was now the country of Einstein and Oppenheimer was reason enough to
            go, but Dyson’s sister Alice says that “he escaped to America so he
            could make his own life,” removed from the shadow of his now famous
            musical father. “I know how he felt,” says Oliver Sacks, who came to
            New York not long after medical school. “I was the fifth Dr. Sacks
            in my family. I felt it was time to get out and find a place of my
            own.”

            In 1947, Dyson enrolled as a doctoral candidate at Cornell, studying
            with Hans Bethe, who had the reputation of being the greatest
            problem-solver in physics. Alice Dyson says that once in Ithaca, her
            brother “became so much more human,” and Dyson does not disagree. “I
            really felt it was quite amazing how accepted I was,” he says. “In
            1963, I’d only been a U.S. citizen for about five years, and I was
            testifying to the Senate, representing the Federation of American
            Scientists in favor of the nuclear-test-ban treaty.”

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            After sizing him up over a few meals, Bethe gave Dyson a problem and
            told him to come back in six months. “You just sit down and do it,”
            Dyson told me. “It’s probably the hardest work you’ll do in your
            life. Without having done that, you’ve never understood what science
            is all about.” This smaller problem was part of a much larger one
            inherited from Einstein, among others, involving the need for a
            theory to describe the behavior of atoms and electrons emitting and
            absorbing light. Put another way, it was the question of how to move
            physics forward, creating agreement among the disparate laws of
            atomic structure, radiation, solid-state physics, plasma physics,
            maser and laser technology, optical and microwave spectroscopy,
            electronics and chemistry. Many were working on achieving this broad
            rapport, including Julian Schwinger at Harvard University; a
            Japanese physicist named Shinichiro Tomonaga, whose calculations
            arrived in America from war-depleted Kyoto on cheap brown paper; and
            Feynman, also at Cornell, a man so brilliant he did complex
            calculations in his head. Initially, Bethe asked Dyson to make some
            difficult measurements involving electrons. But soon enough Dyson
            went further.

            The breakthrough came on summer trips Dyson made in 1948, traveling
            around America by Greyhound bus and also, for four days, in a car
            with Feynman. Feynman was driving to Albuquerque, and Dyson joined
            him just for the pleasure of riding alongside “a unique person who
            had such an amazing combination of gifts.” The irrepressible Feynman
            and the “quiet and dignified English fellow,” as Feynman described
            Dyson, picked up gypsy hitchhikers; took shelter from an Oklahoma
            flood in the only available hotel they could find, a brothel, where
            Feynman pretended to sleep and heard Dyson relieve himself in their
            room sink rather than risk the common bathroom in the hall; spoke of
            Feynman’s realization that he had enjoyed military work on the
            Manhattan Project too much and therefore could do it no more; and
            talked about Feynman’s ideas in a way that made Dyson forever
            understand what the nature of true genius is. Dyson wanted to unify
            one big theory; Feynman was out to unify all of physics. Inspired by
            this and by a mesmerizing sermon on nonviolence that Dyson happened
            to hear a traveling divinity student deliver in Berkeley, Dyson sat
            aboard his final Greyhound of the summer, heading East. He had no
            pencil or paper. He was thinking very hard. On a bumpy stretch of
            highway, long after dark, somewhere out in the middle of Nebraska,
            Dyson says, “Suddenly the physics problem became clear.” What
            Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga were doing was stylistically
            different, but it was all “fundamentally the same.”

            Dyson is always effacing when discussing his work — he has variously
            called himself a tinkerer, a clean-up man and a bridge builder who
            merely supplied the cantilevers linking other men’s ideas. Bethe
            thought more highly of him. “He is the best I have ever had or
            observed,” Bethe wrote in a letter to Oppenheimer, who invited Dyson
            to the institute for an initial fellowship. There, with Einstein
            indifferent to him and the chain-smoking Oppenheimer openly doubting
            Dyson’s physics, Dyson wrote his renowned paper “The Radiation
            Theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger and Feynman.” Oppenheimer sent Dyson
            a note: “Nolo contendere — R.O.” If you could do that in a year, who
            needed a Ph.D.? The institute was perfect for him. He could work all
            morning and, as he wrote to his parents, in the afternoons go for
            walks in the woods to see “strange new birds, insects and plants.”
            It was, Dyson says, the happiest sustained moment in his life. It
            was also the last great discovery he would make in physics.

            Other physicists quietly express disappointment that Dyson didn’t do
            more to advance the field, that he wasted his promise. “He did some
            things in physics after the heroic work in 1949, but not as much as
            I would have expected for someone so off-the-scale smart,” one
            physicist says. From others there are behind-the-study-door
            speculations that perhaps Dyson lacked the necessary “killer
            instinct”; or that he was discouraged by Enrico Fermi, who told him
            that his further work on quantum electrodynamics was unpromising; or
            “that he never felt he could approach Feynman’s brilliance.” Dyson
            shakes his head. “I’ve always enjoyed what I was doing quite
            independently of whether it was important or not,” he says. “I think
            it’s almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize,
            you should have a long attention span, get ahold of some deep and
            important problem and stay with it for 10 years. That wasn’t my
            style.”

            <strong>DYSON HAD ALWAYS</strong> wanted “a big family.” In 1950,
            after knowing the brilliant mathematician Verena Huber for three
            weeks, Dyson proposed. They married, Esther and George were born,
            but the union didn’t last. “She was more interested in mathematics
            than in raising kids,” he says. By 1958, Dyson had married Imme — he
            has the brains, she has the legs, the Dysons like to joke — and they
            settled “in this snobbish little town,” as he calls Princeton. They
            had four more daughters. All six Dysons describe eventful
            child­hoods with people like Feynman coming by for meals. Their
            father, meanwhile, was always preaching the virtues of boredom:
            “Being bored is the only time you are creative” was his thinking.
            George recalls groups of physicists closing doors and saying, “No
            children.” Through the keyhole George would hear words that gave him
            thermonuclear nightmares. All of them remember Dyson coming home,
            arms filled with bouquets of new appliances to make Imme’s life
            easier: an automatic ironing machine; a snowblower; one of the first
            microwave ovens in Princeton.

            Beginning in the late ’50s, Dyson spent months in California, on the
            La Jolla campus of General Atomics, a peacetime Los Alamos, where
            scientists were seeking progressive uses for nuclear energy. After a
            challenge from Edward Teller to build a completely safe reactor,
            Dyson and Ted Taylor patented the Triga, a small isotope machine
            that is still used for medical diagnostics in hospitals. Then came
            the Orion rocket, designed so successions of atomic bombs would
            explode against the spaceship’s massive pusher plate, propelling
            astronauts toward the moon and beyond. “For me, Orion meant opening
            up the whole solar system to life,” he says. “It could have changed
            history.” Dyson says he “thought of Orion as the solution to a
            problem. With one trip we’d have got rid of 2,000 bombs.” But
            instead, he lent his support to the nuclear-test-ban treaty with the
            U.S.S.R., which killed Orion. “This was much more serious than Orion
            ever would be,” he said later. Dyson’s powers of concentration were
            so formidable in those years that George remembers sitting with his
            father and “he’d just disappear.”

            One idea pulsing through his mind was a thought experiment that he
            published in the journal Science in 1959 that described massive
            energy-collecting shells that could encircle a star and capture
            solar energy. This was Dyson’s initial response to his insight that
            earthbound reserves of fossil fuels were limited. The structures are
            known as Dyson Spheres to science-fiction authors like Larry Niven
            and by the writers of an episode of “Star Trek” — the only engineers
            so far to succeed in building one.

            This was an early indication of Dyson’s growing interest in what one
            day would be called climate studies. In 1976, Dyson began making
            regular trips to the Institute for Energy Analysis in Oak Ridge,
            Tenn., where the director, Alvin Weinberg, was in the business of
            investigating alternative sources of power. Charles David Keeling’s
            pioneering measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, showed rapidly
            increasing carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere; and in
            Tennessee, Dyson joined a group of meteorologists and biologists
            trying to understand the effects of carbon on the Earth and air. He
            was now becoming a climate expert. Eventually Dyson published a
            paper titled “Can We Control the Carbon Dioxide in the Atmosphere?”
            His answer was yes, and he added that any emergency could be
            temporarily thwarted with a “carbon bank” of “fast-growing trees.”
            He calculated how many trees it would take to remove all carbon from
            the atmosphere. The number, he says, was a trillion, which was “in
            principle quite feasible.” Dyson says the paper is “what I’d like
            people to judge me by. I still think everything it says is true.”
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Eventually he would embrace another idea: the notorious
            carbon-eating trees, which would be genetically engineered to absorb
            more carbon than normal trees. Of them, he admits: “I suppose it
            sounds like science fiction. Genetic engineering is politically
            unpopular in the moment.”

          <p>
            In the 1970s, Dyson participated in other climate studies conducted
            by Jason, a small government-financed group of the country’s finest
            scientists, whose members gather each summer near San Diego to work
            on (often) classified (usually) scientific dilemmas of (frequently)
            military interest to the government. Dyson has, as he admits, a
            restless nature, and by the time many scientists were thinking about
            climate, Dyson was on to other problems. Often on his mind were
            proposals submitted by the government to Jason. “Mainly we kill
            stupid projects,” he says.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Some scientists refuse military work on the grounds that involvement
            in killing is sin. Dyson was opposed to the wars in Vietnam and
            Iraq, but not to generals. He had seen in England how a military
            more enlightened by quantitative analysis could have better
            protected its men and saved the lives of civilians. “I always felt
            the worse the situation was, the more important it was to keep
            talking to the military,” he says. Over the years he says he pushed
            the rejection of the idea of dropping atomic bombs on North Vietnam
            and solved problems in adaptive optics for telescopes. Lately he has
            been “trying to help the intelligence people be aware of what the
            bad guys may be doing with biology.” Dyson thinks of himself as
            “fighting for peace,” and Joel Lebowitz, a Rutgers physicist who has
            known Dyson for 50 years, says Dyson lives up to that: “He works for
            Jason and he’s out there demonstrating against the Iraq war.”

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            At Jason, taking problems to Dyson is something of a parlor trick. A
            group of scientists will be sitting around the cafeteria, and one
            will idly wonder if there is an integer where, if you take its last
            digit and move it to the front, turning, say, 112 to 211, it’s
            possible to exactly double the value. Dyson will immediately say,
            “Oh, that’s not difficult,” allow two short beats to pass and then
            add, “but of course the smallest such number is 18 digits long.”
            When this happened one day at lunch, William Press remembers, “the
            table fell silent; nobody had the slightest idea how Freeman could
            have known such a fact or, even more terrifying, could have derived
            it in his head in about two seconds.” The meal then ended with men
            who tend to be described with words like “brilliant,” “Nobel” and
            “MacArthur” quietly retreating to their offices to work out what
            Dyson just knew.

          <p>
            These days, most of what consumes Dyson is his writing. In a recent
            article, he addressed the issue of reductionist thinking obliquely,
            as a question of perspective. Birds, he wrote, “fly high in the air
            and survey broad vistas.” Frogs like him “live in the mud below and
            see only the flowers that grow nearby.” Whether the topic is
            government work, string theory or climate change, Dyson seems
            opposed to science making enormous gestures. The physicist Douglas
            Eardley, who works with Dyson at Jason, says: “He’s always against
            the big monolithic projects, the Battlestar Galacticas. He prefers
            spunky little Mars rovers.” Dyson has been hostile to the Star Wars
            missile-defense system, the Space Station, the Hubble telescope and
            the superconducting super collider, which he says he opposed because
            “it’s just out of proportion.” Steven Weinberg, the Nobel physics
            laureate who often disagrees with Dyson on these matters, says:
            “Some things simply have to be done in a large way. They’re very
            expensive. That’s big science. Get over it.”

            Around the Institute for Advanced Study, that intellectual Arcadia
            where the blackboards have signs on them that say Do Not Erase,
            Dyson is quietly admired for candidly expressing his doubts about
            string theory’s aspiration to represent all forces and matter in one
            coherent system. “I think Freeman wishes the string theorists well,”
            Avishai Margalit, the philosopher, says. “I don’t think he wishes
            them luck. He’s interested in diversity, and that’s his worldview.
            To me he is a towering figure although he is tiny — almost a saintly
            model of how to get old. The main thing he retains is playfulness.
            Einstein had it. Playfulness and curiosity. He also stands for this
            unique trait, which is wisdom. Brightness here is common. He is
            wise. He integrated, not in a theory, but in his life, all his
            dreams of things.”

            <strong>IMME DYSON REPORTS</strong> that her husband “recently
            stopped climbing trees.” Dyson himself says he’s resigned to never
            finishing “Anna Karenina.” Otherwise he still lives his days at
            mortality-ignoring cadence, aided by NoDoz, a habit he first
            acquired during his R.A.F. days. He travels widely, giving talks at
            churches and colleges, reminding people how dangerous nuclear
            weapons are. (“I think people got used to them and think if you
            leave them alone, they won’t do you any harm,” he says. “I always am
            scared. I think everybody ought to be.”) He has visited both the
            Galápagos Islands and the campus of Google and attended “Doctor
            Atomic,” the John Adams opera about Oppenheimer, which disappointed
            him. More fulfilling was the board meeting of a foundation promoting
            solar energy in China. Another winter day found him answering
            questions from physics majors at a Christian college in Oklahoma.
            (“Scientists should understand the human anguish of religious
            people,” he says.)

            Lately Dyson has been lamenting that he and Imme “don’t see so much
            of each other. We’re always rushing around.” But one evening last
            month they sat down in a living room filled with Imme’s running
            trophies and photographs of their children to watch “An Inconvenient
            Truth” again. There was a print of Einstein above the television.
            And then there was Al Gore below him, telling of the late Roger
            Revelle, a Harvard scientist who first alerted the undergraduate
            Gore to how severe the climate’s problems would become. Gore warned
            of the melting snows of Kilimanjaro, the vanishing glaciers of Peru
            and “off the charts” carbon levels in the air. “The so-called
            skeptics” say this “seems perfectly O.K.,” Gore said, and Imme
            looked at her husband. She is even slighter than he is, a pretty
            wood sprite in running shoes. “How far do you allow the oceans to
            rise before you say, This is no good?” she asked Dyson.

          <p>“When I see clear evidence of harm,” he said.</p>
          <p>
            “Then it’s too late,” she replied. “Shouldn’t we not add to what
            nature’s doing?”

      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            “The costs of what Gore tells us to do would be extremely large,”
            Dyson said. “By restricting CO2 you make life more expensive and
            hurt the poor. I’m concerned about the Chinese.”

          <p>“They’re the biggest polluters,” Imme replied.</p>
          <p>
            “They’re also changing their standard of living the most, going from
            poor to middle class. To me that’s very precious.”

            The film continued with Gore predicting violent hurricanes, typhoons
            and tornados. “How in God’s name could that happen here?” Gore said,
            talking about Hurricane Katrina. “Nature’s been going crazy.”
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            “That is of course just nonsense,” Dyson said calmly. “With Katrina,
            all the damage was due to the fact that nobody had taken the trouble
            to build adequate dikes. To point to Katrina and make any clear
            connection to global warming is very misleading.”

          <p>
            Now came Arctic scenes, with Gore telling of disappearing ice,
            drunken trees and drowning polar bears. “Most of the time in history
            the Arctic has been free of ice,” Dyson said. “A year ago when we
            went to Greenland where warming is the strongest, the people loved
            it.”

            “They were so proud,” Imme agreed. “They could grow their own
            cabbage.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The film ended. “I think Gore does a brilliant job,” Dyson said.
            “For most people I’d think this would be quite effective. But I knew
            Roger Revelle. He was definitely a skeptic. He’s not alive to defend
            himself.”

            “All my friends say how smart and farsighted Al Gore is,” she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “He certainly is a good preacher,” Dyson replied. “Forty years ago
            it was fashionable to worry about the coming ice age. Better to
            attack the real problems like the extinction of species and
            overfishing. There are so many practical measures we could take.”

          <p>“I’m still perfectly happy if you buy me a Prius!” Imme said.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s toys for the rich,” her husband smiled, and then they were
            arguing about windmills.
