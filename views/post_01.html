            Monarch butterflies look delicate, but they need to be super-tough
            to survive their annual migrations. The monarchs of eastern North
            America may travel thousands of miles to their winter home in
            Mexico’s Sierra Madre mountains. And, increasingly, they’re not
            making it, a problem that has been blamed on habitat loss, climate
            change and pesticides.

            In an effort to boost the struggling insect’s numbers, some
            butterfly enthusiasts buy monarchs raised in captivity or breed
            their own, then set them free. But

            published Wednesday in Biology Letters shows that captive-born
            monarchs are weaker than wild ones — adding evidence to the
            arguments of those who warn that releasing them does more harm than
            good.

            that monarchs raised in captivity are less likely to reach Mexico.
            To find out why this might be, Andy Davis, an ecologist at the
            University of Georgia, and his co-authors raised 83 monarchs in two
            different indoor settings, using eggs from wild butterflies. They
            also caught 41 wild monarchs and brought them into the lab. Then —
            like a miniature NFL combine — they put the insects through a series
            of tests.

      <div>

          <p>
            The scientists measured the monarchs’ wings, because larger, more
            elongated wings are known to help with migration. They also assessed
            the orange color of the butterflies, which can range from pale
            yellow to nearly brick-red. Monarchs with darker orange wings are
            more successful migrators, though this probably has to do with the
            butterflies’ overall fitness and not the color itself.

          <p>
            Finally, the scientists tested the monarchs’ strength. During
            migration, monarchs may have to hold on tightly to trees during high
            winds or storms. The researchers attached a wooden rod to an
            electronic force gauge and wrapped the rod in plastic mesh so the
            butterflies could grip it. Then they had each butterfly grasp the
            perch with its feet, and gently tugged the butterfly upward until it
            let go.

            Wild butterflies dramatically outperformed those born in captivity.
            On average, captive-born monarchs were less than half as strong as
            wild ones. Though their wing size wasn’t significantly different,
            the captive-born monarchs had less elongated wings. They were also
            paler in color.

            Something about rearing monarchs in captivity seemed to make them
            less fit for migration. Dr. Davis thinks the most likely explanation
            is that hand-raising caterpillars is too safe.

            In the wild, monarch caterpillars often become food for other
            animals. Only about five percent reach adulthood, Dr. Davis said.
            That’s before migration, which itself takes a huge toll on the
            population. “Only the strongest, fittest individuals ever make it to
            Mexico,” he said. But in captivity, all the insects survive. “You’re
            basically bypassing natural selection.”

      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Dr. Davis thinks releasing these wimpier bugs en masse could harm
            the whole monarch population. Even if most captive-born bugs die
            during migration, the few that survive might spread their weaker
            genes. (Dr. Davis, citing annual summer surveys, questions whether
            the population as a whole is declining. Either way, though, he says
            the failure of many butterflies to reach Mexico shows their
            migrations are being disrupted.)

            Facebook groups are full of hobbyists who raise and release
            monarchs. Commercial businesses sell the butterflies for mass
            releases at weddings and other events. In all, Dr. Davis estimated
            that people free “easily hundreds of thousands” of captive-born
            monarchs each year. Although these people have good intentions, Dr.
            Davis said, adding huge numbers of monarchs that may be poor
            migrators to the population is “the last thing we should be doing.”

            Marcus Kronforst, an evolutionary biologist at the University of
            Chicago who has

              >also studied captive-born monarchs’ migratory problems</a
            >
            but was not involved in this study, said that Dr. Davis’s study
            shows “pretty striking differences” in the physical traits of
            captive-born monarchs. However, he noted that more might be learned
            by studying captives that were raised outdoors, too. And releasing
            butterflies that weren’t culled by natural selection may not harm
            the gene pool of the whole population, said Ayse Tenger-Trolander,
            Dr. Kronforst’s co-author and a graduate student in his lab.

          <p>
            The researchers stress that raising a few monarchs as a fun family
            project, or for education or citizen science, is fine. Dr. Davis
            said he doesn’t want to stop people from rearing a few monarchs at
            home.

            But either way, the evidence shows that raising and releasing
            monarchs isn’t a good conservation strategy. “Our resources may be
            better spent on habitat conservation and fighting climate change,
            rather than rearing armies of monarchs,” Ms. Tenger-Trolander said.
