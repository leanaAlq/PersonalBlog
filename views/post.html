      <p>
        When we are learning something new, our brains are continually making
        predictions about our environment, then registering whether those
        assumptions are true.
      </p>
      <p>
        A new study has found that our expectations during these predictions
        affects the activity of various brain networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neuroscientists at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum in Germany recently
        reported their findings in two articles in the journals
        <em>Cerebral Cortex</em> and <em>Journal of Neuroscience.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The neuroscientists say they identified two key regions in the brain
        involved in this process. The thalamus plays a central role in
        decision-making. The insular cortex, on the other hand, is particularly
        active when it is clear whether the right or wrong decision has been
        made.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The expectation during learning then regulates specific connections in
        the brain and thus the prediction for learning-relevant sensory
        perception,” said Associate Professor Dr. Burkhard Pleger from the
        Neurological Clinic of Berufsgenossenschaftliches Universitätsklinikum
        Bergmannsheil.
      </p>
      <p>
        For their study, the researchers used a learning task that focuses on
        the decision-making process during the perception of skin contact in the
        brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s like learning a computer strategy game using a game pad, which
        gives sensory feedback to certain fingers on certain stimuli,” explained
        Pleger. “The point is that a certain touch stimulus leads to success and
        that this has to be learned from stimulation to stimulation.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For the experiment, 28 participants were given either tactile stimulus A
        or B on the index finger in each trial run. At the push of a button,
        they then had to predict whether the subsequent tactile stimulus would
        be the same or not. The probability of A and B was constantly changing,
        which the participant had to learn from prediction to prediction, the
        researchers said.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the test, the participants’ brain activity was examined using
        <a
          href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri/"
          >functional magnetic resonance imaging</a
        >
        (fMRI). The researchers said they were particularly interested in the
        trial runs in which the participants changed their decision-making
        strategy. They then asked the question to what extent the change in
        expectations influenced brain activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the researchers, two brain regions stood out: the thalamus and the
        insular cortex.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thalamus processes information that comes from the sensory organs or
        other areas of the brain and passes it on to the cerebrum. It is also
        called the gateway to consciousness, according to the neuroscientists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using functional magnetic resonance images, the researchers were able to
        show that different brain connections between the prefrontal cortex and
        the thalamus were responsible for maintaining a learning strategy or
        changing the strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The higher the expectations before the decision, the sooner the strategy
        was maintained and the lower the strength of these connections,
        according to the study’s findings. With low expectations, there was a
        change of strategy and the regions seemed to interact much more strongly
        with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The brain appears to be particularly active when a learning strategy
        has to be changed while it takes significantly less energy to maintain a
        strategy,” Pleger noted.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So far, the thalamus has been viewed as a switch. Our results underline
        its role in higher cognitive functions that help decision-making while
        learning. So the thalamus is not only a gateway to sensory
        consciousness, but rather it seems to link it to cognitive processes
        that serve, for example, to make decisions.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The insular cortex, on the other hand, is involved in perception, motor
        control, self-confidence, cognitive functions, and interpersonal
        experiences. This part was particularly active when a participant had
        already made his decision and then found out whether he was right or
        wrong, according to the study’s findings.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Different networks that are anchored in the insular cortex are
        regulated by expectations and thus seem to have a direct influence on
        future sensory perception,” said Pleger.
